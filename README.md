## Worlds Best Cheeses ðŸ§€:
### An analysis of the 2021 World Cheese Awards! 

This dataset is very meaningful to me, as it is not only familiar, but personal, on a level. Being a cheesemonger for 7+ years taught me a lot about myself, and those around me. Not only did the job take me to some great places, I got to eat all the cheese I could possibly want! It was really fun exploring this dataset. With that being said, let's jump in!
